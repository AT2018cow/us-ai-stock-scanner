## Quality Applicability

- Company Quality v1 is one common financial-quality core. Specialist accounting semantics (banks, brokers, insurers, REITs, foreign or unsupported reporting models) are pending independent review; until then, cross-model comparability is UNVERIFIED for every decision, and this grade must not be read as sector-relative quality.
- Applicability for THIS decision: not disproven, but still unverified across business models — compare with caution.

## Entry Quality

- State: ENTRY_READY
- Structure: Price holds above its long-term trend inside the readiness band with non-negative momentum — a healthy structure that is not overextended.
- Score: 0.925
- Confidence: 1.0
- Market as-of: 2026-10-12

- `price_near_sma50_ready_band` — Price near SMA50: Price is in the pre-registered SMA50 readiness band. (polarity=positive; metric=price_to_sma50; value=0.99988; threshold=0.98–1.08)
- `return_20d_ready_band` — 20d return in readiness band: Recent momentum is positive/controlled rather than chased. (polarity=positive; metric=return_20d; value=0.084765; threshold=-3% to +12%)
